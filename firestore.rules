/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Konk Media Archive.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, scalable, and maintainable backend by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.  It avoids complex data validation in favor of rapid prototyping but focuses intensely on authorization.  The rules are designed to be independent and avoid chained lookups.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /videoFragments/{videoId}: Stores publicly accessible video fragments.  Write access is restricted to the uploader.
 * - /pendingVideoFragments/{videoId}: Stores video fragments awaiting admin approval. Only admins can manage these.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of a document grants admin privileges to the corresponding user. The document content is irrelevant.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private and only accessible by the user.
 * - Public videos are readable by anyone, but only the uploader can modify them.
 * - Pending videos are only manageable by admins.
 * - Admin status is determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`, not a field in the user document.
 * - Listing of user documents is forbidden.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Video fragments include an `uploaderId` field to enable simple ownership checks without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Approved and pending videos are stored in separate collections to avoid filtering and simplify access control.
